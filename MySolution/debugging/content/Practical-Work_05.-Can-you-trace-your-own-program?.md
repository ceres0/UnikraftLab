Modify your `Echo-back Server` application implemented in the [first](community/hackathons/sessions/baby-steps) session so that each time the server responds with a message, a tracepoint with the corresponding message will be activated.
Save all your tracepoints in a `traces.dat` file and show them in a user-friendly view with `trace.py`.
